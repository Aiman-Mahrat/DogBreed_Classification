# Dog Breed Classification Script

This one of my earliest projects while getting into Pythong and Deep Learning. The concept is simple enough, it classifies whether an image is a dog image or not, and if it is then it classifies the breed of the dog.
The different functions used by the pretrained model named after the file name, as well as the dataset and a folder for the user to upload images. For an introductory project, it served to propell my Python
fundamentals forward when it comes to algorithms and data structures which I would apply in my future projects and academic journey.
